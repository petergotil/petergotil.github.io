Hello! 
Welcome to my personal website.

The code for this site is based heavily off of the pages linked below - the third one was my main source of inspriation with parts that stem from the two others:
  - https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page237/n5
  - http://www.tooplate.com/view/2087-kalay
  - https://mayanigrin.com/

 Anyone can use the code from this website for their own purposes, provided that they link to this site in their respective code.
